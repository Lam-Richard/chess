This project is inspired by (but not at all affiliated with) [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) and of course, Chess Titans from Windows 7.

The end (?) goal of this ongoing project is to thoroughly explore the ins-and-outs of implementing features of modern online chess tooling and platforms, and to envision enhancements to that experience.

*Currently rewriting in SvelteKit and Typescript!*
